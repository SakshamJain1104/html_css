    <h2>HOW DID 17 YEARS OLD SAKSHAM JAIN BECOME A SUCCESSFUL INFLUENCER !</h3><br><br>


            <h3><mark>1. Tell us about your background and journey. <p>
            </h3>

            Hello everyone, My name is Saksham jain. I was a middle-class boy who had to do something different from the
            crowd from the beginning. I am from Indore. I haven't any background in this field.

            I am 17 years old and currently, I am pursuing B.C.A in IPS ACADEMY. <p>My journey as an Influencer started
                in the year 2019. I was in class 10th at that time Back then, Instagram was kind of a very new platform
                where people use it to post their pictures and socialize with other people.


                So, As I was very fond of socializing, I got attracted to this platform, Instagram. In the start,
                definitely I faced a lot of criticism, when I was in class 10th, as I was the only guy in the whole
                school who used STAND OUT in the crowd by doing this because at that time people weren't even aware of
                these things.


                But yes, I never stopped, I never let that criticism get jumped in my mind and I kept on working, and
                moving forward with what I was doing. That's the reason,
                today I'm here. This journey has been a rollercoaster, with a lot of ups and downs, yet being exciting.
                It's been almost 3 years now in this field of content creation and social media influencing, I've worked
                with 200+ brands nationally and even internationally till now. I learned a lot from this journey, and
                even today I'm still learning, getting better, and moving forward.

            <h3><mark>2. What led you to start your page on Instagram and what is it about?</h3>
            <p>

                At first, I just used Instagram as a regular person, like to see content and other stuff to pass my
                time. So, after a while, I thought why not make this simple account of mine into something much
                better. Thus, from there on forward I converted my personal Instagram account into a professional
                account.
            <p>
                I'm working over my page, as a social media influencer and a content creator. I'm open to every kind
                of content over my page. I post about fashion, lifestyle, technology, fitness, and even gaming. I am
                very fond of experimenting with new things and working on them more and more. Being an Influencer,
                brands like to work with me, so I do brand promotions and post about their latest products,
                promoting them.

            <h3><mark>3. Is it financially sustainable to be an influencer today? </h3>

            Yes, it is sustainable but can’t ignore the fact that it is a bit difficult for beginners as well I am
            saying this because nowadays everyone wants to be an influencer.

            Competition is so high and according to me, it depends individually how the one tackles brand and how good
            their content is how they are connected to their audiences and how do they really influences their audience.

            If they really bring value to brands definitely brands are ready to pay and according to me if you’re really
            good at your content then it is easy to sustain but most importantly initially you have to invest money in
            your content so in the end, I will say If one chooses right path than definitely, it is sustainable to be an
            influencer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
